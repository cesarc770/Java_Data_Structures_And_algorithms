# Java Data Structure and Algorithms

Basically, I need to recap what I learned in school and keep my skills on Data Structures and Algorithms up to date. I chose to do it in Java since that is the language I use for work mostly. Feel free to add more problems to solve. I am trying to go through some problems and since I am coding a lot while doing this I might as well put it in Github. 


## Things to be covered

Each branch a different topic:

### Will be covering:

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stack
* Queue
* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* AVL Tree
* Binary Heap
* Hashing
* Sorting
* Graph
* Greedy Algorithm
* Divide and Conquer

## Contributing

Please feel free to add problems and make comments on my implementation.
